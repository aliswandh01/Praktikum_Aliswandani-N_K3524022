  <h2>PTIK FKIP UNS</h2>
  <p>
    The <span id="bagian1">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University</span>,
    Surakarta is an <span id="bagian2">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> 
    which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
    <span id="bagian3">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
    <br><br>
    The <span id="bagian4">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program 
    is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span id="bagian5">Engineering and Vocational 
    Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK 
    study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates 
    who are <span id="bagian6">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>.
    So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as 
    <span id="bagian7">Building Engineering Education,</span> and 
    <span id="bagian8">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in 
    the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct 
    <span id="bagian9">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
